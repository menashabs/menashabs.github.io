This project was done with the purpose of using a time series dataset, fitting the appropriate model and generating forecasts. The users can input a univariate time series dataset or a multivariate time series dataset in the ascending order of date. The app is designed to optimize parameters and fit the most appropriate model. <br>

This project is about data science jobs. The R flexdashboard was created using the data collected from data science job advertisements. This dashboard provides an idea about the job fields, job requirements, expected education qualifications, skills and experience. This project was done under the guidance of <a href="https://thiyanga.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Dr. Thiyanga Talagala </a> who is a Senior Lecturer at the Department of Statistics, Faculty of Applied Sciences, University of Sri Jayewardenepura. <br>

This project is about modelling and forecasting the tea export revenue in Sri Lanka. The data set was collected from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. The impact of COVID-19 on Sri Lankan tea export revenue was assessed. Time series analysis was done under two approaches and a SARIMA model was used to generate forecasts. <br>

This project investigated how the knowledge regarding the myth of HIV/AIDS, “People can get HIV virus from mosquito bites” varies on ever married women’s socio and demographic characteristics. This study is based on Sri Lanka Demographic and Health survey (DHS) in 2016 conducted by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS). A logistic regression model was fitted based on the analysis. <br>
